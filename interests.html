        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Video Games: My first video game ever was <em>Super Mario 3D Land</em>, as I had said earlier. My favorite game ever is <em>Subnautica</em>, however, I believe the best game ever is <em>Minecraft</em> (Favorite: What you as a person enjoyed the most. | Best: What was the highest quality overall).</li>
            <li>Football: I have always been a fan of football. Surprisingly, I haven't always been a Saints fan. I used to actually be a Falcons fan.</li>
            <li>Pickleball: I've only recently become a fan of pickleball. I only became of fan of it after taking some classes for it.</li>
            <li>Basketball: I'm not very good at basketball, but I still enjoy playing a pickup game. However, I suck at 1v1s as I'm more of a setup player who tries to setup an open man, rather than make the plays.</li>
            <li>Music: My favorite genre of music is Hip-Hop. My favorite artists are <em>Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and nobigdyl.</em></li>
