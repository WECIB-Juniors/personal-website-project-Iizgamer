    <section> <!-- Biography -->
        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Nicholas Foles. I am better well known as <strong>Nick</strong>, though. I am a student at Wake Early College of Information & Biotechnologies as a Junior. I am on the <strong>Programming</strong> pathway. When I grow up, I aspire to be a <strong>Software Designer</strong>, which is just a professional way for me to say that I want to design video games. I had worked at <strong>Smithfield's Chicken & Barbeque</strong> for 1 year, and now work at <strong>Rudino's Pizzas and Grinders.</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the works that inspire me are <strong>Super Mario 3D Land, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Subnautica, Undertale, Pokemon Black, Stardew Valley, and Minecraft</strong>. My first experience with video games were when I was 5 years old, when I got a <strong>Nintendo 3DS</strong>. My first game ever was <strong>Super Mario 3D Land</strong>. Ever since I played Super Mario 3D Land, I realized I wanted to design and develop video games, as I even created my own levels using paper and a pencil. Now, however, my taste in games has slightly evolved, and now I want to make more advanced games than just 3D platformers.</p>
        <p>However, I also have passions outside of video games. I also very much enjoy sports. Some of my favorite teams are the <strong>University of Florida, the University of Vanderbilt, the New Orleans Saints, the New Orleans Pelicans, the Carolina Hurricanes, and the Colorado Rockies.</strong> As you can see, all are relatively bad teams. I think my love for these bad teams comes from my love for the underdog, and the chaos they can cause if they simply try. Of course, I also hate them for all of the losing, and subsequent pain they cause me.</p>
